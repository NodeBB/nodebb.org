								The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union law intended to
								promote the protection of privacy and personal information. It's main goal to give users
								more control over their personal data.
							</p>

							<p>
								To that end, we have taken steps to make NodeBB compliant with GDPR for any user who
								wishes to use it. Upon registering for an account, all users will be presented with a
								page outlining their rights, along with what data is collected. A request for their
								consent will be presented, and only upon receipt of affirmative consent, will their
								account be created.
							</p>

							<p>
								With regards to compliance with GDPR in terms of our hosting service, please contact us
								at the mail or email addresses below to receive correspondence and documentation
								regarding our services. Specifically, you can retrieve a copy of our Data Processing
								Agreement for your records by clicking the following link:

								host using NodeBB), please see our <a href="https://blog.nodebb.org/nodebb-1-9-0/">

									<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
								</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>What types of data is collected and processed by NodeBB?</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The complete list of data categories collected and processed by a vanilla NodeBB install
								can be found in our Data Protection Addendum (DPA), the download link of which is located
								above. Feel free to contact us for more details regarding our GDPR implementation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Third-party plugins and themes have the capability to collect additional information, and
								are thus not covered by the existing DPA. You may wish to contact appropriate plugin
								authors to verify GDPR compliance.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>How will my existing users provide consent for data processing?</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								All users are able to review their list of rights and consent status via the "Your Rights
								&amp; Consent" page, accessible via the user settings page in NodeBB. Your existing users
								are able to provide consent here as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								In order to facilitate receipt of consents for all users, you can elect to download and
								install <a href="https://github.com/nodebb/nodebb-plugin-gdpr">the NodeBB GDPR plugin</a>,
								which will allow you to require users to provide consent upon login, and view a list of
								users who have not provided consent yet.
