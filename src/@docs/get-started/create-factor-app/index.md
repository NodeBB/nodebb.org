## Generate An App

The easiest way to set up a fully-featured Factor application is to use the scaffolding tool `create-factor-app`. This tool creates a new project for you and includes recommended tooling and files.

To run this tool, just type the following in your terminal (_yes, it just works nothing else is necessary_)

```bash
npx create-factor-app <folder-name>
```

_or with Yarn:_

```bash
yarn create factor-app <folder-name>
```

Once launched, it will walk you through the next steps.

Once the utility has finished setting up your project, all you need to do from here is run your development server.

```bash
npx factor dev
```
