# Endpoints and Middleware

Endpoints and middleware are the primary mechanisms for performing "trusted" transactions in your app's server environment. This includes handling payment information or saving data to your database.

## What are endpoints?

Whenever you want a user to perform some secured action, like saving their account data, they have to make a request to your server. On your server you then need to verify their identity, handle the request data, then perform the transaction.

In Factor, endpoints automate all the boiler plate in this process. Use them when you need to perform trusted actions on the server that are triggered from the client. For examples of what you might do:

- Run a custom database query
- Send notification emails
- Save a new subscription to Stripe

Endpoints are built on top of Express server middleware discussed below.

## Creating an Endpoint

To create an endpoint all that is needed is to run the `addEndpoint` function inside the server environment and pass along the methods that should be available.

```js
import { addEndpoint } from "@factor/api"

// Endpoint method on server
export const exampleEndpointMethod = async (params, meta) => {
  return params.text + " world"
}

// Add an endpoint
addEndpoint({
  id: "my-endpoint",
  handler: { exampleEndpointMethod },
})
```

## Making Endpoint Requests

Now that we've created the endpoint, we can make a request to it. This is usually done from the 'app' environment and uses the function `endpointRequest`.

```js
import { endpointRequest } from "@factor/api"

const result = await endpointRequest({
  id: "my-endpoint",
  method: "exampleEndpointMethod",
  params: { text: "hello" },
})

// hello world
```

The above is a simple example, but in practice, endpoints are primarily used for performing custom queries on the [database](./database) or using APIs for trusted transactions (e.g. Stripe transactions, sending email, etc..).

## Bearer (Authentication)

Since the Factor server doesn't know about the authentication state of users, endpoint requests using `endpointRequest` are sent with an `Authorization` header. This header is the token discussed in [authentication](./authentication) document.

On the server, this token is securely decoded to the user and passed along to all endpoint functions as the `bearer`. Any secure operations on the server should verify that the bearer user has the needed privileges and information to act.

```js
// Endpoint method on server
export const exampleEndpointMethod = async (params, meta) => {
  const { bearer } = meta

  if (bearer.accessLevel > 100) {
    return "cool"
  } else {
    return "not cool"
  }
}
```

## Endpoint Meta

Other information set as meta to all endpoint methods:

- **request** - the Express request
- **response** - the Express response
- **source** - the ID of the app sending the request. This is useful when multiple apps are sharing the same DB.

## Creating Middleware

Middleware is an [Express concept](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html). It is a common way to add server functionality at URLs and is lower level than the endpoints system. A typical use case is to handle image uploads.

```js
import { addMiddleware } from "@factor/api"

addMiddleware({
  key: "exampleMiddleware",
  path: "/_example",
  middleware: [
    async (request, response) => {
      const { query, body } = request

      const data = { ...body, ...query }

      // do something

      response.send("did something").end()

      return
    },
  ],
})
```

With the above middleware, at the route `/_example`, your server will output "did something" instead of showing a standard 404 message.
